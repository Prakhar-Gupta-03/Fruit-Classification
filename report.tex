    This report presents a machine learning project completed for the course \textit{CSE 342: Statistical Machine Learning} at the \textit{Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, New Delhi}. The project, a Kaggle competition, involved creating an accurate fruit classification model with 20 possible labels. 
    The report briefly describes the problem statement, the data set provided, and the different pre-processing steps taken to prepare the given data for analysis. It then outlines the various machine learning algorithms tested during the project, including the respective results, observations, and evaluation metrics. 
    The report concludes with a summary of the project and provides relevant references. Overall, the report serves as a comprehensive summary of the project, presenting the application of various machine learning algorithms.
